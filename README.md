# Riparian Vegetation Effects on Aquatic Macroinvertebrates

Hypothesis: 

Data Description: We will be working with two data sets from NEON; the Riparian % cover (DP1.20191.001) and the Macroinvertebrate collection (DP1.20120.001). For each of these datasets, we will be selecting three sites, one in Upper Big Creek, California (D17:BIGC), one in Mayfield Creek, Alabama (D08:MAYF), and one in Oksrukuyik Creek, Alaska (D18:OKSR). These sites were selected because of their relatively large geographical distance. We further selected from 2017 to 2022 based on the availability of sampling years for most sites. Both data sets only had a few samples per year, so multiple years will be used to estimate a more holistic pattern. In the macroinvertebrate data, we will be using each unique species name from each sampling period to estimate species richness for these sites. In the riparian data, we will be using percent cover estimated by vegetation density to measure the impact of surrounding vegetation on macroinvertebrate communities. The three sites offer a wide range of stream characteristics and vegetation type which allows for potentially more general conclusions about the effect of riparian zones. Each sample site is detailed by NEON with pictures of the general layout.
