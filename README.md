# Riparian Vegetation Effects on Aquatic Macroinvertebrates

Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that a decrease in the riparian buffer percent cover will result in a decrease of aquatic macroinvertebrates richness. We are focusing in on the riparian buffer percent involving urbanization, agrilctural usage, and forested areas. Looking into the affect the land use changes can have on macroinvertebrates populations when the riparian buffer is decreased. We will test our hypothesis by looking at three different locations with differing land use. The first location is Upper Big Creek, California looking at urbanization, the second is Mayfield Creek, Alabama looking at agricultural usage, and the final location is Oksrukuyik Creek, Alaska and is rural. Over multiple years we will be analyzing the effect of riparian cover on the aquatic macroinvertebate species richness. We will be comparing species richness by the uniqueness of species genus and species names. 

Data Description: We will be working with two data sets from NEON; the Riparian % cover (DP1.20191.001) and the Macroinvertebrate collection (DP1.20120.001). For each of these datasets, we will be selecting three sites, one in Upper Big Creek, California (D17:BIGC), one in Mayfield Creek, Alabama (D08:MAYF), and one in Oksrukuyik Creek, Alaska (D18:OKSR). These sites were selected because of their relatively large geographical distance. We further selected from 2017 to 2022 based on the availability of sampling years for most sites. Both data sets only had a few samples per year, so multiple years will be used to estimate a more holistic pattern. In the macroinvertebrate data, we will be using each unique species name from each sampling period to estimate species richness for these sites. In the riparian data, we will be using percent cover estimated by vegetation density to measure the impact of surrounding vegetation on macroinvertebrate communities. The three sites offer a wide range of stream characteristics and vegetation type which allows for potentially more general conclusions about the effect of riparian zones. Each sample site is detailed by NEON with pictures of the general layout.
